# HTML Primer mini project

## Introduction

This is a mini project to review HTML basics and how HTML can be mixed with Javascript code when using JXS, which is a superset of JavaScript supported by the React development tool. We also introduce in this mini project the Bootstrap CSS framework.

## Preparing the project

To create the project, open a new command prompt, navigate to a convenient location and run the command as follow:
**`npx create-react-app primer`**


## Adding the Bootstrap package to the project

Once the project has been created, run the following commands to navigate to the project folder and install the Bootstrap CSS framework.

**`cd primer`**

**`npm install bootstrap@4.1.2`**

## Including Bootstrap in index.js in the src Folder

To include Bootstrap in the application, add the statement below in the index.js file.

**`import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css`**

## Preparing the HTML file and the Component

We start by replacing the content of the index.html in the _public_ folder with the content shown below.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
